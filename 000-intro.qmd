## What is Econometrics?

- **Theoretical economic models** explain the qualitative relationship between different economic variables

    - e.g., Consumption is expected to increase as disposable income and wealth increase (positive relationship)

- However, few models indicate the **magnitude** of the relationship

    - Yet this is what matters most to policymakers. 

    - Central bankers need to know how much a 1 percentage increase in the interest rates will have on inflation and the growth rate of the economy

## What is Econometrics?

> Econometrics uses economic theory, mathematics, and statistical inference to quantify economic phenomena

- The **objective** of econometrics is to convert *qualitative* statements into *quantitative* statements

- *the relationship between two or more variables is positive* vs. *consumption expenditure increases by 95 cents for every one dollar increase in disposable income*

## The Challenge

- The gold standard for drawing inferences about the effect of a policy is a **randomized controlled experiment**

- However, in many cases, experiments remain difficult or impossible to implement
    - for financial, political, or ethical reasons, or because the population of interest is too small.

## The Challenge

- Unethical: Prevent potential students from attending college in order to study the causal effect of college attendance on labor market experiences, 

- Politically infeasible: Study the effect of the minimum wage by randomly assigning minimum wage policies to states.

## The Challenge

- A large share of the empirical work in economics about policy questions relies on **observational data**

    â€” data where policies were determined in a way other than through random assignment

- Drawing inferences about the causal effect of a policy from observational data is **challenging**

## Minimum Wage Example

> To understand the challenges, consider the example of the minimum wage. A **naive** analysis of the observational data might compare the **average employment** level of states with a *high minimum wage* to that of states with a *low minimum wage*. This difference is surely *not a credible* estimate of the **causal effect** of a higher minimum wage, defined as the *change in employment that would occur if the low-wage states raised their minimum wage*. For example, it might be the case that states with higher costs of living, as well as more price-insensitive consumers, choose higher levels of the minimum wage compared to states with lower costs of living and more price-sensitive consumers.

## Confounders

- These factors, which may be unobserved, are said to be **confounders**

- Confounders induce correlation between minimum wage policies (explanatory variable) and employment (response variable) that is not indicative of what would happen if the minimum wage policy changed

## Identification Strategies

- In economics, researchers use a wide variety of *strategies* for attempting to draw **causal inference** from observational data

- These strategies are often referred to as **identification strategies** or empirical strategies, because they are strategies for identifying the causal effect

- We say, somewhat loosely, that a causal effect is identified if it can be learned when the dataset is sufficiently large.

## Machine Learning and Econometrics

- **Supervised machine learning** focuses primarily on *prediction* problems

- **Unsupervised machine learning** focuses on methods for *finding patterns* in data, such as groups of similar items, like clustering images into groups, or putting text documents into groups of similar documents.

## ML vs Econometrics

- ML approach is fundamentally *different* from the goal of **causal inference** in observational studies, 
    - where we observe data on outcomes and a treatment variable, and we wish to draw inferences about potential outcomes

- the main focus of supervised machine learning is on prediction performance without regard to the implications for inference

## ML vs Econometrics

- supervised machine learning methods typically rely on data-driven model selection, most commonly through cross-validation,

- in econometrics, the model is informed by economic theory


## ML vs Econometrics

| Discipline | Model Selection | Focus |
|:-----------|:----------------|:------|
| Econometrics | Economic Theory | Causal Inference |
| Supervised ML | Data-driven | Prediction |
: Econometrics vs. Machine Learning

## Stages of Development

1. By relying on economic theory, formulate a hypothesis to explain the data being examined
1. Develop an identification strategy to account for confounders
1. Apply the identification strategy to test the hypothesis using statistical tools

- Focus of this course is to introduce the statitical tools
